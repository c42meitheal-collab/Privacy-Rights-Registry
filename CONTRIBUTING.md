# Contributing to Privacy Rights Registry

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Privacy Rights Registry! This project aims to prevent stalking and doxxing whilst creating legal liability for privacy violations in Ireland.

## üéØ Project Mission

We're building infrastructure that:
- **Prevents stalking/doxxing** at the technical level
- **Creates legal liability** for companies that ignore privacy rights
- **Positions Ireland** as a leader in digital privacy rights
- **Operates within existing law** (no new legislation required)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (production) or SQLite (development)
- Redis (for rate limiting)
- Docker (optional but recommended)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xbard-C42/privacy-rights-registry.git
   cd privacy-rights-registry
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local values
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Set up frontend** (if contributing to UI):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose exec api pytest

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_main.py::TestAntiDoxxingProtection

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Security Tests**: Anti-doxxing protection validation
- **Compliance Tests**: GDPR/Irish law compliance
- **Load Tests**: Performance under stress

### Writing Tests

- All new features must include tests
- Focus on security-critical functionality
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test anti-doxxing protection thoroughly

## üìù Code Style

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Check style
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### TypeScript/React Code Style

```bash
# In frontend directory
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

### Key Principles

1. **Security First**: Every change must maintain security
2. **Privacy by Design**: Default to maximum privacy protection
3. **Irish Context**: Consider Irish legal/political context
4. **Performance**: Anti-doxxing checks must be fast
5. **Auditability**: Log all security-relevant actions

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Critical Security Requirements

1. **Never disable anti-doxxing protection** without explicit user consent
2. **All database queries** must be parameterised (no SQL injection)
3. **Rate limiting** must be maintained on all endpoints
4. **Audit logging** is mandatory for all privacy-related actions
5. **Password requirements** cannot be weakened
6. **JWT tokens** must have proper expiration

### Security Review Process

- All PRs undergo security review
- Anti-doxxing functionality requires extra scrutiny
- Database changes need migration review
- Authentication changes require senior review

## üèõÔ∏è Legal and Compliance

### Irish Law Compliance

- Must comply with Data Protection Act 2018
- Must align with Irish government digital standards
- Consider Oireachtas committee recommendations
- Respect existing GDPR implementation

### Political Considerations

- Green Party adoption is a priority
- Consider impact on Irish digital sovereignty
- Align with progressive privacy policies
- Build for government deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Fail Secure**: If something breaks, default to blocking access
2. **Audit Everything**: Log all privacy-relevant actions
3. **Rate Limit Everything**: Prevent abuse at the infrastructure level
4. **Validate Everything**: Never trust user input
5. **Encrypt Everything**: Data at rest and in transit

### Database Design

- Use foreign keys for data integrity
- Index fields used in queries
- Store audit logs immutably
- Hash all passwords with bcrypt
- Use JSON fields for flexible rights storage

### API Design

- RESTful endpoints with clear naming
- Consistent error response format
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Comprehensive input validation
- JWT authentication for companies
